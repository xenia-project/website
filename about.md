## Overview

### Project Origin

The project began when I ([@benvanik](https://twitter.com/benvanik)) was between
jobs and wanted to hack on something fun. I'd picked up some region-locked
Japanese games when I was visiting Tokyo and was frustrated I couldn't play them
on my 360, so I started researching the 360 homebrew scene. I'd previously
written a [PlayStation Portable emulator](https://code.google.com/p/pspplayer/)
and enjoyed it, noticed no one was playing with a 360 emulator, and thought
'what the hell'. Since then it's been an on-again off-again project done in my
spare time when bored (or when [@gibbed](https://twitter.com/gibbed) has some
time and gets me excited).

### Why?

Because it's fun!

### Future Plans

None! There's a [roadmap](/roadmap/), but the project has largely achieved what
I set out for it to do (waste time building something cool), and now is purely a
passion project in my spare time. In addition to getting some of my favorite
games to play I'm really just hacking to have fun.
